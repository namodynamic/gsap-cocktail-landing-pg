## Overview

This is a fully responsive, visually rich cocktail website powered by GSAP animations. It features advanced scroll interactions like parallax effects, pinned sections, scroll-synced video playback, SplitText reveals, and an animated carousel. I built this project as part of my learning journey to sharpen my frontend skills and deepen my understanding of GSAP and scroll-based animations in modern web design.
